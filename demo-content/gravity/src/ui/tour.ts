// inertia → orbit as falling-and-missing → the Moon → 3D → axial spin → the

Park on one and you keep station with Earth, so the whole map turns as a single piece, once a year; the camera rides along and visits each point in turn. L1, L2 and L3 sit on saddles: level along the ridge, downhill along the Sun–Earth line, so a probe slides off and has to thrust back every few weeks. SOHO and DSCOVR do that at L1, 1.5 million km sunward, watching the Sun; Webb and Euclid do it at L2, as far out the other way, facing away from it — and none of them sits still: each loops a wide halo round its point, up out of the plane and back. L3, on the far side of the Sun, is forever hidden from us, so nobody parks there. L4 and L5, sixty degrees ahead and behind on two equilateral triangles, are hilltops that trap rather than shed: nudge a rock off one and the turning frame curls it back into a long tadpole loop, which is why they collect asteroids — thousands at Jupiter, two confirmed at Earth’s L4.

To zagnieżdżenie sprawia, że Księżyc krąży wokół Ziemi, a nie wprost wokół Słońca — przekrocz granicę, a przejmuje kolejne ciało.

Masa i energia zakrzywiają samą tkankę przestrzeni i czasu wokół siebie, tak jak ciężka kula wgniata napiętą tkaninę. Pobliski obiekt nie jest „przyciągany” siłą — po prostu podąża najprostszą możliwą drogą w tej zakrzywionej przestrzeni, wtaczając się w studnię. Newton nie jest jednak w błędzie: jego prawo to dokładnie to, czym staje się teoria Einsteina, gdy grawitacja jest słaba, a prędkości dużo mniejsze od prędkości światła — te same spadające orbity, które widziałeś, lecz z głębszym wyjaśnieniem.',

Ta drobna różnica przez dziesięciolecia pozostawała niewyjaśniona — aż ogólna teoria względności przewidziała dokładnie 43″. Zakrzywiona czasoprzestrzeń Słońca obraca orbitę.

Zaparkuj w takim punkcie, a utrzymasz pozycję względem Ziemi, więc cała mapa obraca się jak jedna całość, raz na rok; kamera jedzie razem z nią i odwiedza kolejne punkty. L1, L2 i L3 leżą na siodłach: płasko wzdłuż grzbietu, z górki wzdłuż linii Słońce–Ziemia, więc sonda się zsuwa i co kilka tygodni musi zawracać silnikami. Robią tak SOHO i DSCOVR w L1, 1,5 miliona km w stronę Słońca, patrząc na nie, oraz Webb i Euclid w L2, równie daleko w przeciwną stronę, odwróceni od niego — i żadne z nich nie stoi w miejscu: każde kreśli szerokie halo wokół swojego punktu, w górę ponad płaszczyznę orbity i z powrotem. L3, po drugiej stronie Słońca, jest przed nami na zawsze ukryty, więc nikt tam nie parkuje. L4 i L5, sześćdziesiąt stopni przed planetą i za nią, na dwóch trójkątach równobocznych, to wzniesienia, które łapią, a nie zrzucają: zepchnięta z nich skała wraca, zawinięta przez obracający się układ w długą pętlę w kształcie kijanki — dlatego gromadzą asteroidy: tysiące u Jowisza, dwie potwierdzone w L4 Ziemi. Sonda Vigil z ESA ma dotrzeć do L5 w latach 30., by widzieć burze słoneczne, zanim obrócą się w naszą stronę.

Podczas całkowitego zaćmienia w 1919 roku Eddington zmierzył ugięcie zgodne z tym przewidywaniem, późniejsze pomiary je potwierdziły, a Einstein z dnia na dzień stał się sławny na cały świat. Dziś to „soczewkowanie grawitacyjne” zamienia całe galaktyki w kosmiczne szkła powiększające.

Tuż obok gaz spada po spirali i rozgrzewa się do milionów stopni, płonąc jako dysk akrecyjny, a samo światło potrafi okrążać dziurę w cienkim jak brzytwa pierścieniu fotonowym.

W 2015 roku detektory LIGO złapały taką falę z dwóch czarnych dziur, które zderzyły się 1,3 miliarda lat temu — rozciągając swoje 4-kilometrowe ramiona o mniej niż tysięczną część szerokości protonu.

Z dwóch powodów. Po pierwsze, oś obrotu jest wciąż skierowana tak samo w przestrzeni, niezależnie od miejsca na orbicie; wirujące ciało utrzymuje swój kierunek. Po drugie, Polaris jest oddalona o 433 lata świetlne, więc cała szerokość naszej orbity przesuwa jej pozorne położenie o dużo mniej, niż zdoła wychwycić oko. Ten kierunek nie jest jednak zupełnie zamrożony: grawitacja Słońca i Księżyca szarpie wybrzuszony równik Ziemi i sprawia, że oś chwieje się jak powolny bąk, zataczając na niebie koło raz na 26 000 lat.
